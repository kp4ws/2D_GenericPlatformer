# 2D_GenericPlatformer
***Work In Progress***

## About ##
2D Platformer I'm creating in Unity. For now, I'm focusing on getting the basic mechanics working (such as player movement). After this, I plan on giving this project a proper name instead of "2D_GenericPlatformer".

## The Idea ##
I want to create a 2D platformer game that's simple but also very fun, similar to the original Super Mario Bros.
